Creating Solutions with Microsoft Advanced Analytics – Train the Trainer
 
There are many resources you can use to learn the technologies Microsoft has for advanced analytics, such as documentation sites, the Microsoft Virtual Academy and more. Each of these resources can lead your customers through the specifics of Machine Learning, the Azure Data Catalog, Microsoft R and more to a very detailed level. But the amount of documentation and the spread of platforms it lives on can be overwhelming not just for the customer, but for the technical and business teams that face the customer who wants to implement an advanced analytics solution.
 
The “Building Solutions with Cortana Intelligence” course leads a technical professional through 2 days of intensive, hands-on, lab-based instruction by the AI and Research team. This course has been taught at multiple locations around the world. It uses the Team Data Science Process (TDSP) and multiple technologies to guide the team through an end-to-end solution highlighting multiple technologies from ingestion, inspection, processing, routing, Machine Learning, and consumption of the results. The customer gets a “big picture” with a high level of detail and multiple resources to be successful.
 
This one-day session is aimed at the trainer for this course. It’s designed to explain how the course works, what you need to learn to teach it, and how to run the class. It also covers how to alter the course to a one-day or half-day course, and how to break apart the modules and topics into smaller content, customer demos, or presentations. You’ll also learn how to edit the material to use a customer solution in place of the solution in the course, as a possible demo or POC. You’ll receive all instruction, labs, and resources you need to redeliver and redesign the course.

			About the Course:
			In this workshop you’ll cover a series of modules that guide you from understanding an analytics workload, using the Team Data Science Process, the Cortana Intelligence Suite Platform, the foundations of data transfer and storage, data source documentation, storage and analytics processing using various tools in a comprehensive solution. You’ll learn how to work through a real-world scenario using the Cortana Intelligence Suite tools, including the Microsoft Azure Portal, PowerShell, and Visual Studio, among others. You'll learn how to leverage the Cortana Intelligence Solution Portal to rapidly deploy a pre-configured solution, and you'll learn how to modify a solution for a real-world implementation.

			This course is designed to take approximately one to two days, depending on what is covered and how many of the labs are done in-class. The longer course is marked (Extended Class). All materials are provided regardless of the length of the course. 

			Prerequisites:
			There are a few things you will need in order to properly follow the course materials:

			A subscription to Microsoft Azure (this may be provided through your company or as part of your invitation – you must have this enabled prior to class – you will be using Azure throughout the course, for all labs, work and exercises). You can use your MSDN subscription – https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/memberoffers/msdn-benefits/, your employer may provide Azure resources to you, but make sure you check to see if you can deploy assets and that they know you’ll be using their subscription in the class. 

			A laptop capable of using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) - all lab work will be done on the Microsoft Azure Windows Data Science Machine.
